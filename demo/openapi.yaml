    # Introduction
    This is the QPay API documentation that is intended to help customer of QPay understand and implement our payments API.

    # Advantages of paying using Quickpay
    CoDi is payment system extremely unique in the world and that is leading the innovation across the world with regards to payment methods.
    Unlike most payment systems in the world, the Mexican Central Bank (BANXICO) created a centralized system called SPEI, which allows banks
    to send money to one another instantly without waiting days for it to settle. In top of this system lies CoDi, an additional
    layer of abstraction that allows final users to send money through QR codes, Near Field Communication (NFC) or by sending a push
    notification to the payer user.

    # Our product
    Our product intents to facilitate the access to CoDi to e-commerce businesses by creating an easy to use API to process
    the payments between online merchants and their customers. Once the merchant is onboarded into the system, they will be
    able to use our API which provides additional security features than the ones offered by BANXICO, it has simplyfied the
    payment process to a few endpoints that allow the merchant send a payment and know the status of the transaction.

    # Authentication
    How Authentication works

    We dont know yet

    I made a small change, let see how it looks
